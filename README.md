I know, why the hell did I commit .env file!? Well this is only for learning purposes :)
As you can see I uploaded MEN (not MERN yet :) ) to show you how MongoDB and Node Express communicate through CRUD operations.
I took book managamenet system as an easy, beginner-friendly example where users are able to add new book, get all or particular book and delete all of them or one of them. 
Later, I'm gonna commit changes with UPDATE methods and add React Native user interface as a full stack beginner project.
